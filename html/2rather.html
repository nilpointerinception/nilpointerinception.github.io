<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named
  <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to
  create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
